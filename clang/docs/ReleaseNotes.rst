Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the Clang C/C++/Objective-C
frontend, part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release 10.0.0. Here we
describe the status of Clang in some detail, including major
improvements from the previous release and new feature work. For the
general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <https://llvm.org/docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM
releases may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web
site <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about Clang or LLVM, including information about the
latest release, please see the `Clang Web Site <https://clang.llvm.org>`_ or the
`LLVM Web Site <https://llvm.org>`_.

Note that if you are reading this file from a Subversion checkout or the
main Clang web page, this document applies to the *next* release, not
the current one. To see the release notes for a specific release, please
see the `releases page <https://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

What's New in Clang 10.0.0?
===========================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Clang are listed
here. Generic improvements to Clang as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by language-specific
sections with improvements to Clang's support for those languages.

Major New Features

Attribute Changes in Clang
--------------------------

- ...

Windows Support
---------------

- clang-cl now defaults to ``/Zc:twoPhase`` if targeting MSVC2017 update 3 or
  later (``_MSC_VER`` >= 1911). This matches MSVC's behavior. Explicitly pass
  ``/Zc:twoPhase-`` to restore the old behavior.
- ...

C Language Changes in Clang

- ...

C11 Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CUDA Support in Clang

Internal API Changes
--------------------

These are major API changes that have happened since the 9.0.0 release of
Clang. If upgrading an external codebase that uses Clang as a library,
this section should help get you past the largest hurdles of upgrading.

Build System Changes
--------------------

These are major changes to the build system that have happened since the 9.0.0
release of Clang. Users of the build system should adjust accordingly.

- In 8.0.0 and below, the install-clang-headers target would install clang's
  resource directory headers. This installation is now performed by the
  install-clang-resource-headers target. Users of the old install-clang-headers
  target should switch to the new install-clang-resource-headers target. The
  install-clang-headers target now installs clang's API headers (corresponding
  to its libraries), which is consistent with the install-llvm-headers target.

- In 9.0.0 and later Clang added a new target, clang-cpp, which generates a
  shared library comprised of all the clang component libraries and exporting
  the clang C++ APIs. Additionally the build system gained the new
  "CLANG_LINK_CLANG_DYLIB" option, which defaults Off, and when set to On, will
  force clang (and clang-based tools) to link the clang-cpp library instead of
  statically linking clang's components. This option will reduce the size of
  binary distributions at the expense of compiler performance.

Additional Information
======================

A wide variety of additional information is available on the `Clang web
page <https://clang.llvm.org/>`_. The web page contains versions of the
API documentation which are up-to-date with the Subversion version of
the source code. You can access versions of these documents specific to
this release by going into the "``clang/docs/``" directory in the Clang
tree.
