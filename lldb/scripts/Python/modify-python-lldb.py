# modify-python-lldb.py
#
# This script modifies the lldb module (which was automatically generated via
# running swig) to support iteration and/or equality operations for certain lldb
# objects, implements truth value testing for certain lldb objects, and adds a
# global variable 'debugger_unique_id' which is initialized to 0.
#
# As a cleanup step, it also removes the 'residues' from the autodoc features of
# swig.  For an example, take a look at SBTarget.h header file, where we take
# advantage of the already existing doxygen C++-docblock and make it the Python
# docstring for the same method.  The 'residues' in this context include the c
# comment marker, the trailing blank (SPC's) line, and the doxygen comment start
# marker.
#
# In addition to the 'residues' removal during the cleanup step, it also
# transforms the 'char' data type (which was actually 'char *' but the 'autodoc'
# feature of swig removes ' *' from it) into 'str' (as a Python str type).
