Improvements to clang-tidy
--------------------------

- New OpenMP module.

  For checks specific to `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org/>`_ API.

- New :doc:`abseil-duration-addition
  <clang-tidy/checks/abseil-duration-addition>` check.

  Checks for cases where addition should be performed in the ``absl::Time``
  domain.

- New :doc:`abseil-duration-conversion-cast
  <clang-tidy/checks/abseil-duration-conversion-cast>` check.

  Checks for casts of ``absl::Duration`` conversion functions, and recommends
  the right conversion function instead.

- New :doc:`abseil-duration-unnecessary-conversion
  <clang-tidy/checks/abseil-duration-unnecessary-conversion>` check.

  Finds and fixes cases where ``absl::Duration`` values are being converted to
  numeric types and back again.

- New :doc:`abseil-time-comparison
  <clang-tidy/checks/abseil-time-comparison>` check.

  Prefer comparisons in the ``absl::Time`` domain instead of the integer
  domain.

- New :doc:`abseil-time-subtraction
  <clang-tidy/checks/abseil-time-subtraction>` check.

  Finds and fixes ``absl::Time`` subtraction expressions to do subtraction
  in the Time domain instead of the numeric domain.

- New :doc:`bugprone-unhandled-self-assignment
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-unhandled-self-assignment>` check.

  Finds user-defined copy assignment operators which do not protect the code
  against self-assignment either by checking self-assignment explicitly or
  using the copy-and-swap or the copy-and-move method.

- New :doc:`bugprone-branch-clone
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-branch-clone>` check.

  Checks for repeated branches in ``if/else if/else`` chains, consecutive
  repeated branches in ``switch`` statements and indentical true and false
  branches in conditional operators.

- New :doc:`google-readability-avoid-underscore-in-googletest-name
  <clang-tidy/checks/google-readability-avoid-underscore-in-googletest-name>`
  check.

  Checks whether there are underscores in googletest test and test case names in
  test macros, which is prohibited by the Googletest FAQ.

- New :doc:`google-objc-avoid-nsobject-new
  <clang-tidy/checks/google-objc-avoid-nsobject-new>` check.

  Checks for calls to ``+new`` or overrides of it, which are prohibited by the
  Google Objective-C style guide.

- New :doc:`objc-super-self <clang-tidy/checks/objc-super-self>` check.

  Finds invocations of ``-self`` on super instances in initializers of
  subclasses of ``NSObject`` and recommends calling a superclass initializer
  instead.

- New alias :doc:`cert-oop54-cpp
  <clang-tidy/checks/cert-oop54-cpp>` to
  :doc:`bugprone-unhandled-self-assignment
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-unhandled-self-assignment>` was added.

- New alias :doc:`cppcoreguidelines-explicit-virtual-functions
  <clang-tidy/checks/cppcoreguidelines-explicit-virtual-functions>` to
  :doc:`modernize-use-override
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize-use-override>` was added.

- The :doc:`bugprone-argument-comment
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-argument-comment>` now supports
  `CommentBoolLiterals`, `CommentIntegerLiterals`, `CommentFloatLiterals`,
  `CommentUserDefiniedLiterals`, `CommentStringLiterals`,
  `CommentCharacterLiterals` & `CommentNullPtrs` options.

- The :doc:`bugprone-too-small-loop-variable
  <clang-tidy/checks/bugprone-too-small-loop-variable>` now supports
  `MagnitudeBitsUpperLimit` option. The default value was set to 16,
  which greatly reduces warnings related to loops which are unlikely to
  cause an actual functional bug.

- The :doc:`google-runtime-int <clang-tidy/checks/google-runtime-int>`
  check has been disabled in Objective-C++.

- The `Acronyms` and `IncludeDefaultAcronyms` options for the
  :doc:`objc-property-declaration <clang-tidy/checks/objc-property-declaration>`
  check have been removed.

- The :doc:`modernize-use-override
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize-use-override>` now supports `OverrideSpelling`
  and `FinalSpelling` options.

- New :doc:`llvm-prefer-isa-or-dyn-cast-in-conditionals
  <clang-tidy/checks/llvm-prefer-isa-or-dyn-cast-in-conditionals>` check.

  Looks at conditionals and finds and replaces cases of ``cast<>``,
  which will assert rather than return a null pointer, and
  ``dyn_cast<>`` where the return value is not captured. Additionally,
  finds and replaces cases that match the pattern ``var &&
  isa<X>(var)``, where ``var`` is evaluated twice.

- New :doc:`modernize-use-trailing-return-type
  <clang-tidy/checks/modernize-use-trailing-return-type>` check.

  Rewrites function signatures to use a trailing return type.

- The :doc:`misc-throw-by-value-catch-by-reference
  <clang-tidy/checks/misc-throw-by-value-catch-by-reference.rst>` now supports
  `WarnOnLargeObject` and `MaxSize` options to warn on any large trivial
  object caught by value.

Improvements to include-fixer
-----------------------------

- New :doc:`openmp-exception-escape
  <clang-tidy/checks/openmp-exception-escape>` check.

  Analyzes OpenMP Structured Blocks and checks that no exception escapes
  out of the Structured Block it was thrown in.

- New :doc:`openmp-use-default-none
  <clang-tidy/checks/openmp-use-default-none>` check.

  Finds OpenMP directives that are allowed to contain a ``default`` clause,
  but either don't specify it or the clause is specified but with the kind
  other than ``none``, and suggests to use the ``default(none)`` clause.

Improvements to clang-include-fixer
-----------------------------------

The improvements are...

Improvements to modularize
--------------------------

The improvements are...

Improvements to pp-trace
------------------------

- Added a new option `-callbacks` to filter preprocessor callbacks. It replaces
  the `-ignore` option.
